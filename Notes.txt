Foreign key constraints
------------------------
- The 'cascade' attribute will mean that the child rows will be deleted etc when the parent is first.


* Sub queries can be expensive. Can you find an alternative way of returning the same result set?

Aggregate Data
---------------
The 'Having' keyword can apply filtering after aggregating/grouping has occurred and as such will behave like a WHERE clause but
afterwards.

Many to Many
------------
It is very important to mark join table entries as unique.

Indexing
--------
- Like giving the db an index. Like alphabetical order in a phone book.
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM sakila.film_actor where film_id = 25; - the EXPLAIN command can give you a load of info about
the query like the number of rows being examined. This can typically be reduced by adding indexes. If the 'Type' column
is set tp 'All' it means there are no indexed and it may be an idea to add some indexing.

Use WHERE downloaded_at BETWEEN '2019-01-01 00:00:00' and '2020-01-01 00:00:00' to reduce searchable rows.

- If there are no indexed fields in the WHERE clause this can lead to long queries time as the db will have search through
all the rows. EXPLAIN will have a 'type' of 'index' if there are indexes on the table but none are being used in the query.
- GROUP BY can further increase query time.

If we put an index on downloaded_at on the above table, this could drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to run
the query. Use EXPLAIN to compare the difference.

In MYSQL and some other SQL DBs, indexes are added on foreign key relationships automatically. Some SQL DBs don't do this.
If you ever use an SQL DB which doesn't add foreign key indexes automatically they will have to be included in your migrations.
